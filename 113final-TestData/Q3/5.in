gambling Japan
The Japanese parliament passed a new law early Thursday that paves the way for a gaming industry that could generate more than billion a year, according to analysts. At the moment, casinos are illegal in the world s third largest economy. The world s leading operators regard Japan as a holy grail given the potential market size, analysts at brokerage CLSA said in a research note. Big players such as Las Vegas Sands LVS and MGM Resorts MGM are strong contenders to enter the Japanese industry, experts say, but local firms could also have an important role. Not everyone welcomes the change. There is little public support for legalizing casinos, and groups have warned of the potential social costs. The issue is not whether gambling facilities are allowed or not, it is about measures to deal with gambling addiction, Noriko Tanaka, the secretary general of campaign group Society Concerned about Gambling Addiction, said in a statement. In an opinion poll this week by Japanese broadcaster NHK, of those surveyed said they opposed the casino bill, while only supported it. The rest were undecided. Some forms of gambling are already permitted in Japan. They include government controlled betting on horse races and the legal gray area of pachinko, a highly popular pinball like game where people play for non cash prizes but often exchange them for money off the premises. Tanaka s group says Japan already has a higher rate of gambling addiction than many other countries.
