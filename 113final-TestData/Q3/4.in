Trang Vietnam
When I fled Vietnam as a child, I never imagined that the islands we attempted our escapes from would one day become luxurious beach resorts. But more than years later, that s exactly what s happening around Nha Trang, a seaside town where I grew up about miles north of Saigon or Ho Chi Minh City that s become a small hub for island getaways in Vietnam. If you love finding a piece of tropical paradise as much as I do, Vietnam has some beautiful and intriguing offerings in Nha Trang and beyond, including islands that were once used to lock up prisoners. On the south central coast of Vietnam, where the temperature is hot year round, Nha Trang has long been a popular vacation spot for locals. But in the, when Vietnam opened its doors to the outside world again, Nha Trang began attracting international travelers seeking a beach break between Saigon and Hanoi. Palm tree shaded beaches, striking ancient temples, cheap hotels, fresh seafood grilled right on the beach, mind numbing booze cruises for just a few bucks and a lively bar scene where locals, expats and tourists happily mingled at oceanfront places like the Sailing Club made Nha Trang a fun place to party and relax. After nearly years since my last visit, I returned to Nha Trang last February for Tet, the Lunar New Year holiday. I was overwhelmed by all the changes. First there was the landing in the reconstructed Cam Ranh International Airport about miles from Nha Trang, a facility built by the Americans during the war as part of a large military base and later also used by the Russian Air Force. All around me, I heard Chinese and Russian being spoken. Now with reasonably priced direct flights from Moscow and Guangzhou, Nha Trang has become a hot spot for Russians and Chinese looking to escape winter. Like much of Vietnam, this once laid back city has gone through a hotel building frenzy with no signs of stopping, including some high end luxury options. Big chains like the Sheraton and resorts like Mia and Amanoi are already catering to Nha Trang s more upscale market. If budget is not an issue and you want indulgence and seclusion, Six Senses Ninh Van Bay offers villas with private pools, starting at dollars per night. The resort is not on an island per se, but rather nestled on the remote Ninh Van Bay surrounded by majestic mountains, a minute boat ride from Nha Trang. A spa, tennis, water skiing, hiking and even cooking classes are available at the resort. Nha Trang is a vibrant city but it can get crowded and hectic, especially during the holidays. For unspoiled beaches and peace and quiet, it s best to hop to a nearby island. On the more affordable end is Whale Island, an eco friendly resort with basic amenities just a two hour boat ride from Nha Trang. I explored the island when it first opened years ago and fondly recall how pristine and stunning it was. The resort has since updated and expanded its facilities but has kept its no parties, no noise, no frills vibe. There s an abundance of activities for nature and water sport lovers, including diving, snorkeling, sailing and kayaking.
