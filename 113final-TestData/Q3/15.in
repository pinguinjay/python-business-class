Blade Soul is a Korean fantasy martial arts massively multiplayer online role playing game developed by NCSOFT Team Bloodlust. On September, NCSOFT announced that Blade Soul would release in Western territories, which eventually happened on January. A Japanese animated television adaptation began airing on April, on TBS and other stations. Blade Soul features a combination of martial arts inspired combat and qinggong in an open world environment. Players create playable characters that explore around the world by completing quests assigned by various NPCs. The game uses a real time battle system in the third person camera view and requires players to combo a series of attacks, much like that of fighting games. According to NCSOFT, the game also features an innovative Downed mechanic, allowing players to recover from the brink of death. Players begin with player versus environment PvE but may participate in player versus player PvP combat later in the game.
