entertainment air
Air travel photos from the s show smartly dressed, champagne sipping passengers in spacious airliner cabins. Contrast that with today s cramped seats and overcrowded airports and it looks like our flying experiences are getting steadily worse. But is this based on reality? The aviation industry has been investing massively to prove nostalgic travelers wrong. Yes, aircraft may still look similar to those of the so called golden years. But every single aspect of the air travel experience is currently being overhauled all driven by technology. Right at the forefront are airplane cabins. And key to their transformation is wireless connectivity. With virtually every passenger toting a smartphone, tablet or laptop, inflight Wi Fi is opening up new ways to engage with air travelers and redefine the flying experience. Mobile tech already plays an important role in enhancing travel, from electronic boarding passes to last minute bids on biz class upgrades. Some airlines, such as KLM, have even started sending boarding passes and flight alerts through a dedicated airline Facebook Messenger chat bot. But the one area where mobile can become truly transformative is inflight entertainment, with personal devices becoming gateways to a whole range of up in the air services. While built in in flight entertainment systems are unlikely to vanish, particularly on long haul flights, they can work in tandem with the passenger s own devices. Earlier in, Panasonic unveiled Waterfront, a system that allows the passengers to use their mobile handsets to control an aircraft s built in entertainment. Aerospace companies Thales are also using mobiles to personalize passenger experiences. By syncing with handsets, their seats know a passenger s preferences and can even restart a movie at the exact place where they left it in the previous flight. Some airlines are doing away with embedded entertainment systems altogether. They re opting for passenger s handsets to deliver inflight entertainment a move that crucially reduces aircraft weight and frees up cabin space. No Internet connection is required, passengers just connect their devices to an in plane network.
