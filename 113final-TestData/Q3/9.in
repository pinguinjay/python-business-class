Christmas goose
In Latin America it s spicy tamales. In the Czech Republic it s a rich feast of breadcrumb encrusted carp. When it comes to Christmas dinner, there are almost as many varieties as there are cultures. Even the stalwart British tradition of turkey with all the trimmings gives way to pancakes in the Netherlands, goose in Germany and fish in Italy. From meatless feasts to fur coat fish, here are just some of the ways people celebrate Christmas around the world. Weihnachtsgans, or German Christmas goose, is the traditional fowl that anchors family feasts around the country, though roast duck is becoming increasingly popular too. My Mom makes weihnachtsgans every year to this day, says Max Hess, a Milwaukee based German American who visits Germany every year for Christmas. It s German tradition to give our gifts on Christmas Eve rather than Christmas Day, so we eat the goose and, as soon as it gets dark, proceed to share gifts with friends and family. Gourmetten is a typical Dutch Christmas dinner tradition, where a group of people sit at a table and cook their own little dishes in small pans atop a large hot plate, says Maartje Frederiks, CEO of the meal delivery group HelloFresh Benelux. It is reminiscent of the Swiss and French raclette, though instead of grilling cheese on a communal grill, Dutch people grill a variety of meat, fish and vegetables. Additionally, the Dutchies like to bake small omelets or pancakes, and dress the experience with a variety of different sauces and bread with garlic butter, says Frederiks.
